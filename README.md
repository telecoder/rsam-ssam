# rsam-ssam

This program attempts to be a rsam/ssam graph generator compatible with FDSN, SeedLink and Winston wave servers. Graphs can be periodically generated as well as on demand via a web interface.

rsam and ssam graphs are useful for volcano monitoring and research.

Graphs can be made for very long periods of time, as long as your wave server can handle the load, so please check with your IT team first.
